# EV3-Remote-Control
Bluetooth Remote control for Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick

The real objective is to create a pseudo-assembler for the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 brick. To thoroughly test this as I develop it I am embedding it inside an application that operates as a PC based Bluetooth remote control where you can add buttons that have miniature programs behind them.

I am using Bluetooth because it is convenient and works, but obviously wireless and USB are simple changes to implement if you want.

The motivation behind this is to open up the Lego EV3 to other programming languages, since I find the current offerings less than ideal for one reason or another and assembler is a useful intermediary.

This is written in Delphi (version 10.2)
